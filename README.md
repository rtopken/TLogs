# TLogs
Collects all the Teams diagnostic logging and places the files in the user's Downloads\TLogs folder, and zips them up into TLogs.zip.
Just run the tool and it will do what it does - and then it will open the TLogs directory for you.
You can then send the TLogs.zip file to the support team.

Check out the Wiki for more info.
